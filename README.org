* Personal config
This is my attempt at a single repo config setup. I recently learned about GNU Stow, and wanted to use it to use it manage all my config.

** Usage

Using stow is very simple, all you need to know is in the man, but here is a short example:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
stow -t -R ~/.config config/
#+END_SRC

this will symlink all the config in the =config= folder into ~/.config folder.
